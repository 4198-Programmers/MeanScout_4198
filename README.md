# MeanScout_4198

Fork of Aidunlin's MeanScout. See https://github.com/Aidunlin/MeanScout.  
This fork will stay on HTML and will not adopt any upstream code for the forseeable future.  

The biggest reason to choose this fork over Aidunlin's wonderful code is for this code's (haphazardly programmed) assigned robot numbers. Instead of scouts accidentally selecting the same robot due to miscommunication, robot positions are preprogrammed ahead of each match in the website's code. This makes this code a little more inflexible, but it was a neccesary change for my sanity as well as everyone else's. To import a match itinerary, see https://gist.github.com/jmelancon/98017522fc9f53694ee6b22fd729f817. Take the output from this script and replace matchListings with it.
