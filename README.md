# MeanScout
An FRC scouting web app

We currently are using our BunnyBots 2019 scouting criteria to develop the app. We will update the app once we finalize our criteria for Infinite Recharge.

## Features
- Progressive Web App - full offline support
- w3.css - mininal and responsive css framework
- Dark-only theme with red/blue color variants
- Simple error checking for scouting criteria
- Never deletes scouting data - provides redundancy
- Uses `localStorage` to store entries
- Download saved entries as `surveys.txt`

### Planned Features
- Templates - fully customizable with in-app creator
- Google Drive integration
- Exporting methods - `csv`, `json`, etc

## Installing MeanScout
You should be able to add/install MeanScout as an app from the browser menu.
If you can't find it, you can still use the app as normal.
